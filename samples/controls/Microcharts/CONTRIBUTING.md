### I wish to help, what's the basics to what I need to know?

first and foremost, thank you for your help and interest.

master currently has 1.0 code so it's best to put new things in there unless it's a fix for the 0.9 codebase which then you develop off the develop branch.

if you're adding a new framework (MAUI, UWP), please ensure you'll be around to actively support it, please no web frameworks as the library is largely used by the mobile & desktop community of the .NET family.
