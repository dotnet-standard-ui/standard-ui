# üê±‚Äçüêâ DinoCat

A proof of concept C# UI library. Goals are current highly aspirational. See [Progress](README.md#Progress) for current progress.

## Beautiful UI Anywhere

Create high quality UI that is consistent and runs with native performance across a wide variety of devices. Write controls that integrate seamlessly with existing C# UI frameworks.

## Easy to Learn and Use

If you already know C# you can get started writing UI today! DinoCat makes your life easier by reducing the number of new concepts you have to learn. You can take advantage of the next generation of C# tooling to make writing UI in C# high efficient.

If you're already using an existing C# UI framework (WinForms, Wpf, Xamarin, Uwp, WinUI) that's great too! You can start using DinoCat controls without any extra work. You can even write new controls in DinoCat that reuse your existing user controls and view models. DinoCat works best with MVVM so your existing experience transfers directly into DinoCat.

## Progress

* Basic Wpf integration
  * Projections from Wpf to DinoCat (need better container support)
  * Projections from DinoCat to Wpf (very early)
* Cross platform rendering with SkiaSharp

## Missing Features

* Animations
* Control library
* Rich text layout
* RTL layout
* WinForms/Xamarin/Uwp/WinUI integration
* HotReload integration (DinoCat is set up for hot reload. Once the tooling catches up this should be easy...)
* And lots more... Everything is very early and needs another iteration or so...
